            <h3>Primary objective</h3>
            <p>The main objective of this project is to introduce a seperate module as an addition to the existing
                MegaMek program that allows for the digital construction of mobile structures. The size and complexity 
                of these units is extreme compared to other units you are already able to construct within the program, 
                and as a junior/amature programmer myself I forsee there will be many complications along the way.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
            <h3>Future plans</h3>
            <p>Eventually, I would hope to fully intigrate the module with the main MegaMek program, thus allowing for
                the use of mobile structures in the gameplay module for use by the AI or by players against the AI or even other players. 
                This would be a very signifigant undertaking, as it would likely require large changes and additions to be made 
                to the existing MegaMek AI system.</p>
