            <h2>The largest planetary units in the game</h2>
            <p>
                Seldom seen and few in number, the class of unit known as mobile structures are enormous in size both on the table and in the lore.
                Outclassed only by some spaceborn vehicles, 
                mobile structures completley overshadow everything else you're likely to see on the table and can carry enough firepower to destroy entire armies at once.

                <h4>What can they do?</h4>
                <p>Almost anything you can imagine!
                    Mobile structures are not limited simply to military applications. 
                    While a giant mobile fortress is certainly the flashiest way to make a mobile structure, 
                    you can just as easily make a massive cargo vessel, 
                    a mobile trasport for space vessels, 
                    or a base of operations for a coorporation, government, or a military force.</p>

                <h4>Different styles of structure.</h4>
                <p>There are several different types of mobile structure that can be made. 
                    More information about the different types is covered on the 
                    Construction Rules page, but there are three basic options you can pick for your structure moves:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>It can crawl over land with massive tank tracks.</li>
                    <li>You can have it float on, or even under, the sea as a ship or submersible.</li>
                    <li>You can even have it float around the skies as a massive airship!</li>
                </ul>
