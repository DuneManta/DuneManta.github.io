            <h2 class="center">Building a mobile structure</h2>
            <p>The rules for constructing a mobile structure are deep and complex. With multiple different motive types, 
                structure strengths, and restrictions on their size and equipment they're allowed to mount 
                based on their chosen attributes. As an example, only reinforced structure styles are allowed 
                to mount large military grade weapons. Anything using a lighter construction class is limited to 
                using much smaller and less capable weapons. Similarly the airship motive type can't use higher classes
                of construction strength at all, and have a lot of forced restrictions as a result. 
                The higher your construction strength is, the harder to damage and destroy your final structure 
                will be. It also affects your maximum allowed size, with the stronger construction types being 
                allowed more hexes for equipment and other items.</p>
            
            <p>Values on this table are mostly placeholders at this time, and will be later replaced with correct 
                and more thorough information once the actual rules are able to be copied into the table.</p>
